## üáÆüá≥ India-Specific Data

### Filtering Criteria Used:
- **Team**: "India"
- **Season**: "Summer" only
- **Year**: 1948 onwards (post-independence)

### Expected India Data:
- **Athletes**: 779 unique Indian athletes (1948-2016)
- **Olympic Games**: 18 Summer Olympics
- **Sports**: 23 different sports
- **Actual Unique Medals**: **23** (1948-2016)
  - Gold: 6, Silver: 5, Bronze: 12
- **Medal Records**: 140 (counts each athlete on medal-winning teams)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Don't confuse "medal records" (140) with "actual medals" (23).
Team sports like Hockey inflate the record count since each player gets an entry.

### Top Sports for India:
1. **Hockey** - Most successful historically
2. **Wrestling** - Strong recent performance
3. **Shooting** - Consistent medals
4. **Boxing** - Emerging strength
5. **Badminton** - Recent success

## üìä Data Quality Notes

### Missing Values:
- **Age**: ~10% missing
- **Height**: ~60% missing
- **Weight**: ~62% missing
- **Medal**: ~92% missing (most athletes don't win medals)

### Handling Strategy:
- Age, Height, Weight: Filled with median values
- Medal: NaN treated as "No Medal"

## üìù Usage Notes

### In Jupyter Notebook:
```python
# Load main dataset
df = pd.read_csv('../data/athlete_events.csv')

# Load NOC mappings
noc_df = pd.read_csv('../data/noc_regions.csv')

# Filter for India (Summer Olympics, 1948+)
india_df = df[
    (df['Team'] == 'India') & 
    (df['Season'] == 'Summer') & 
    (df['Year'] >= 1948)
].copy()
```

### In Streamlit App:
The app loads pre-processed CSV files from the `app/` folder:
- `india_olympics_data.csv` - Filtered and cleaned India data
- `yearly_aggregated_data.csv` - Year-level features
- `top_athletes.csv` - Top performing athletes
- `sports_medals.csv` - Sport-wise medal counts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Data Version**: This dataset goes up to 2016 Olympics. For 2020/2024 data, you'll need to source separately.

2. **Team Names**: Some historical variations exist (e.g., "India" vs "British India"). Our filter uses "India" for post-1947 data.

3. **Medal Counts**: In team sports, each team member gets counted individually, so medal counts may seem higher than official tallies.

4. **Data Accuracy**: While comprehensive, there may be minor discrepancies with official IOC records.

## üîÑ Updates

To update with newer Olympic data:
1. Download updated dataset from Kaggle or Olympic databases
2. Replace the CSV files in this folder
3. Re-run the Jupyter notebook to regenerate processed files
4. Restart the Streamlit app
